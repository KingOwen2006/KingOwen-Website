                            <h3>Surveys</h3>
                            <p>Surveys are one way of primary research to get feedback or to gather information about an
                                audience. Primary research is first-hand research that is done by you and is more
                                reliable than secondary as that has already been done before and could be out of date.
                            </p>
                            <p>A survey can vary depending on the results you want to get out of it. Anyone can take part
                                in a survey, however, awareness depends on the scope of your audience and product. A
                                survey can be done both on paper and online. For example, you could ask members of a
                                Discord server, share on a Twitter page, or if using paper, ask people in person.</p>

                            <h3>Types of questions</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li><b>Closed questions</b> — normally has 2 answers such as Yes/No.</li>
                                <li><b>Open questions</b> — allows the audience to write their own detailed answer, which
                                    can be useful for feedback.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Surveys can sometimes result in biased opinions. However, if you make questions and
                                choices cover both sides of an argument, you can achieve fair and unbiased results.</p>

                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li>Peak player count: 84 players</li>
                                <li>User reviews: Mostly Positive — 71.58% SteamDB rating</li>

                            <p>This game is based on the anime <i>Black Clover</i>, following an alternative storyline as
                                a team battle. The lower player count may be due to lack of advertising. Personally, the
                                game felt unpolished, almost like a beta. Movement felt stiff, and visuals could have
                                been improved. For example, character designs didn’t feel like they were taken directly
                                from the anime, unlike <i>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</i> which looks more faithful to
                                its source material.</p>
