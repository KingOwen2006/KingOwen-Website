                            <p>In Week 2 our course was beginning to pick up pace. We explored more features within
                                Blender that I hadn’t used before, such as rendering and lighting. The image you can see
                                continues from last week where I added an eye and wing but kept the main shape — it
                                started to look like a seagull, which I thought was a cool idea.</p>

                            <h3>What’s new</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li>made a lighting room</li>
                                <li>lighting using a sun</li>
                                <li>coloured in the duck</li>
                                <li>added eyes and wings</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Method used (lighting room)</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li>add a cube</li>
                                <li>delete 3 faces of the cube (left, right, top)</li>
                                <li>bevelled the edge between back and floor face</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Settings used (sun)</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li>colour #B6E6FF</li>
                                <li>strength 3.5</li>
                                <li>angle 90</li>
                                <li>location (12, 3, 9)</li>
                                <li>rotation (415, 47, 385)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>For the seagull colour I only changed the base colour as I am not familiar with Blender’s
                                material graph. However, I will need to use it later to texture my models and improve
                                their look instead of flat shading.</p>

                            <h3>Colour codes</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li>#FFFFFFFF</li>
                                <li>#FF9000FF</li>
                                <li>#000000FF</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Method used (wings)</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li>extruded the middle face of the body on the side view</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Method used (eyes)</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li>selected a face on the head for eye placement</li>
                                <li>Shift + S → cursor to selected (spawn point)</li>
                                <li>Shift + A → add a circle (16 sides for low poly look)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>This is all we did in Blender this week and I was proud of what I achieved. I touched on
                                elements I had never tried before. I would not flat shade the seagull next time and
                                would choose better colours — this will improve as I learn Blender’s material graph.</p>

                            <p>We were also introduced to Adobe Premiere Pro. We learned about types of camera shots and
                                their effects in storytelling.</p>

                            <h3>Camera shots</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li><b>Wide shot</b> — shows both world and characters head-to-toe, capturing
                                    interactions.</li>
                                <li><b>Close-up shot</b> — focuses on part of a character for intensity.</li>
                                <li><b>Long shot</b> — similar to full shot but emphasizes environment over characters.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Extreme close-up</b> — very close, creating tension or fear.</li>
                            </ul>


                            <h3>Camera angles</h3>
                            <ul class="week-list-item">
                                <li><b>Wide shot</b> — shows both world and characters head-to-toe, capturing
                                    interactions.</li>
