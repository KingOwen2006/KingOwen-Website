            						<p class="blank-line">In Week 2 our course was being to pick up paste this was because we explored more features within blender which I haven’t touched on before that being rendering and lighting. The image you can see is the carry on from last week where I add a eye and wing but didn’t mess around with the shape this is because the shape grown on me and looks more like a seagull which I thought was a cool idea. </p>

            						<p class="blank-line">This is all we did in blender this week and I was very proud on what I managed to achieve as I have touched elements of blender which I haven’t done before. But I would definitely not flat shade the seagull and would choose better colours as it looks bland and unfinished. However, this will come with experience of using blender material graph.</p>
            						<p class="blank-line">&nbsp;</p>
            						<p class="blank-line">Also during this week we was introduced to Adobe Premiere Pro for a short amount of time but during these lessons we learned about the types of camera shots that you can have and why they are important with their effects.</p>

            						<p class="blank-line">Types of shots</p>
            						<ul class="made-a-lighting-room-lighting">
              							<li class="made-a-lighting">Full shot this is when both the world and characters are within the shot. The impact of the a full shot is for the viewer to see the character head to toe and how they interact with the world.</li>
              							<li class="made-a-lighting">Close up shot this is when the camera is close normally only showing half of a characters body or less. This is to be used for intense scenes which can shown as threading.</li>
              							<li class="made-a-lighting">Long shot this one is very similar to full shot but captures more of the world than the characters. This shows how the world interacts with the character.</li>
              							<li class="made-a-lighting">Extreme close up shot this one is very very close. This is to be used for intense scenes which can shown as threading or fear.</li>
