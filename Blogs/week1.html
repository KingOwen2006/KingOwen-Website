                                session of the year. This was a good ease into what would be coming up in the future in
                                order to help others reformila themself to the program or for those that have never
                                touched blender. I was quite formila in the method that we was going to use this was
                                because I have used blender numerous times in the past.</p>

                            <p class="in-my-first">Overall, I am happy with the look of the duck as I was experimenting
                                with new key binds which I hope will become my main this is because they was easier to
                                use but needed to get more formilla with it. The duck model itself could have done with
                                a more duck like shape and smoother edges this is because it looks a bit too sharp and
                                that next time I need to use a reference instead of free handing it. However, I like the
                                general shape but is a little sharp.</p>
