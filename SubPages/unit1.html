                I created a mood board because I need to brain storm some ideas for
                what model I should make. These were my ideas which I thought of.
                I also decieded to use a range of references and different styles
                to pick which one I thought would be best to do for the Unit.
                I came up with 4 ideas which then I had to choose from.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Why I didn't choose the other models?</h2>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>
                    Spaceship - I didn't chose to model a spaceship this is because it
                    can prove difficult this is because you can make it as easy or
                    hard as you like. From low poly to si-fi which can change the
                    difficulty by a lot therefore, that would be too much to concider.
                    With a limited deadline I thought that I should not do this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Car - I didn't chose to model a car this is because I would of ended
                    up over complicating things and picking the correct car model would be
                    hard and also choosing a style (low poly, realistic or anime). This would
                    overwealm me therefore, I didn't pick this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Guns - I didn't model a gun this is because I think that a gun would
                    be fun to model however, can be complicated depending on the style and
                    gun itself. I also didn't want to do a gun because I thought that they
                    look too plain if not enough detail is done and I could get side tracked.
                    Due to wanting to add more detail to it. But, this could have been a
                    good model to do this is because I could have used my <b>Airsoft rifle</b>
                    as a first hand reference allowing me to add more detail to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ship - From low poly to high poly which can change the difficulty by a lot
                    therefore, that would be too much to concider. However, if I break the model
                    down I and focus on one part of trhe ship such as the cannon this could work.
                    This is because I would be able to add detail and not get overwhelmed by modelling
                    the entire ship.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Why I choose the cannon</h2>
            I decided to do 18th century naval cannons this because I believe that this model
            could help me with time management and would allow me to meet the deadline. I decided
            to make it anime themed because I think it would be fun to try and achieve this style.
            However, I didn't want to do a typical anime cannon this is because they can be very
            si-fi and futuristic which I thought would be a bit more difficult therefore, choosing
            something that had a lot of secondary research and references could help me undertsand
            new methods of modelling. I decided I like the theme of the ship so I decided
            to go with the cannon which is a small segment of a bigger picture.

                I asked questions to help me understand my audience better. Such as wheather they are
                intreased in naval games if so which ones. I saw that most of my audince are under 18
                with most that like the historic 18th century. 60% of people are not into naval combat
                with one saying they are more of a car guy. I did make a typo in the form it was suppose

                <strong>Week 1:</strong>I managed to create a client profile which
                allowed me to start creating a mood board plan of ideas for which they
                might like. I then decided to make a form which contain research on
                who my audince is. After I found out they wanted a cannon I decided to create
                a second mood board which will allow me have a deeper idea of what I
                am creating. This is good as it allows references and to understand
                what I am making better. As well as started to write my research and
                plan. This was a easy week and was able to do in 1 - 2 days. I also
                performed my primary research to find out more on who my audince is.

            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Week 2:</strong>I started looking for a cannon blueprint which
                would allow me to see the different parts of the cannon in more
                detail. After researching a while I managed to find one which showed
                the parts and what I was aiming to model. I then inserted it into
                blender and managed and started modelling which you can find in the
                production section. As well as I finished my research and plan. But
                this is still a early version of it and will need to be rewritten.

                <strong>Week 3:</strong> This is when I started my first attempt but
                it wasn't good and that I had to redo it this set me back however, the
                new method made it quick and easy to catch up therefore, I didn't fall
                behind as much as I thought I would have this means that I was on
                schedule for my deadline.

                <strong>Week 4:</strong>This is when I started writing the reflection
                and rendering this is because the rendering did not take long and I
                knew already what I needed to work more on with the final week fast
                approaching I had to make a few shortcuts which then effected the
                quality of my model which I could have improved on.

                <strong>Week 5:</strong> This is the week when I decided to make sure
                that I covered all the work for the assessment this therefore, this
                was a mostly a typing week. So not much progress was made. However,
                I did quickly add some new features in the models however, hard to#
                tell the difference. If I had more time I could have fixed some of the
                materials and more details.

            <h2 class="subsection-title">My client profile</h2>
            <hr class="section-divider" />
            My client is a game designer who needs a cannon model for his upcoming
            18th century naval game that will have a anime aesthetic but would
            like 2 coloured renders and 2 clay renders as a wat to showcase their game. 
            I am aiming to do a mid poly build which allows me to get a good amount of detail but not at
            the cost of more geometry than needed. For my requirements I would
            need to make sure that I stay with quads and avoid n-gons this is
            because in game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity they
            triangulate the mesh. It also helps in future proofing the model this
            is because people can do animations easier. This means a large variety
            of people will be using this model such as the game developer and
            their team this means I will have to bare that in mind as I will need
            to make sure the topology is good. The cannon will be placed upon a
            ship and can be animated with recoil and aiming allowing a better
            experience for the player. It will also be used for rendering this is
            because they want to include a sneak-peak towards their small indie
            company. This will be useful for the client as it is a important part
            of the game as it is a core mechanics. They will be using Unreal Engine 5
            for this game and therefore, tris are not something to worry about unlike if
            it was Roblox Studio.

            <p class="section-text">
                This is my secondary research on 18th century cannons.

                The first recorded use of a cannon in Europe was to defend the city of
                Algeciras during the siege of 1343-44. This was the start of the
                cannon era as it continued to evolve cannons where separated by 3
                classes This often depended on the size of the cannon ball as well
                as there are different weight.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>18</strong>:</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>24</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>32</strong>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>64</strong>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>68</strong>
                </li>

            </ul>

            This is the weight that the cannon balls weighted and would often effect the range and accuracy of it.

            <div class="image-gallery-vertical">
                <img src="../Images/Unit1/About.png" alt="">

            </div>

            The cannon was separated into 7 sections which are labelled in the image above.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Muzzle:</strong>The muzzle is a point of vulnerability as if there was too much pressure the
                    cannon could peel like a banana as this is where the cannon ball is released from. </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chase:</strong> This is the thinnest part of the cannon and was also to help to improve
                    accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>First/Second reinforce</strong> This helped reinforce the cannon so that it reduces the
                    chance of peeling.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Vent</strong> This was so that there was a way to provides an external opening to ignite the
                    propellant charge of gunpowder inside the barre
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Base ring:</strong> This was a primary attachment point for a breeching loop
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Cascable:</strong> This part was also for a attachment.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>68</strong>
                </li>



            </ul>

            <p class="section-text">
                In the 18th century cannons could be made out of both iron and bronze they both had advantages and
                disadvantages depending on what it was used for. Iron ones are more common this is because it was
                lighter and less pricy however, it was more weaker to the elements and rusted easily.

                        This one was inspired by a little part from Mr_Forke The Basics of Anime in Blender #3.2 -
                        Advanced Anime Wood Textures combined with the cannon material which gave me the wood effect for
                        both wood material 1, 2 and the cannon shading.
                        I decided to have 2 wood materials as wheel would often be a darker variant of the wood. I also
                        did a render.

                    I learned to make a cannon in a time effective way with good quality. Using unique methods as I did
                    not see people using the same method as me.

                These was the top results that I found however, I did not follow them as I wanted to try and be
                independent
                but I do think if I wantched them start to finish it could of helped me expand my knowledge mainly the
                first
                video for the cannon base this could of made the model look more detailed as well as following their
                tutorial
                for the shading of the cannon which I could have messed around with in order to get the look I wanted.

                This was good as I had to learn through my own mistakes
                which allowed me to get a greater understanding of Blender. However, there are areas of improvement
                such as shading since I do not think it catches the anime aesthetic which I was aiming for but, for
                my first introduction to shading in blender I think it was good. I could have done deeper research
                into the a pacific type of anime style instead of anime in general. This could have helped me
                understand more of what I was doing within the shading.

                I also learned not to settle for your first attempt this is because I didn't do a lot of detail and
                that the original mesh wasn't too great and lacked a lot of detail which was shown later in my newer
                mesh. But in both files I could have improved the naming of each separate mesh instead of letting
                Blender generate names for me.

                I had my first go at trying to use the shading graph in blender and understanding the usage of it.
                However, this is one of my weaker areas and need to gain more knowledge on it.

                <p class="section-text">
                    In this attempt I made it near enough as the method mentioned in my. However, I
                    decided to make it using a cylinder for the main part of the cannon and to make the wheels more
                    bulky.
                    This caused the cannon to look sharp and more cubic.

                    I also rushed this cannon which made me to take shortcuts and not care about the model as much as I
                    should have done. On the other hand though it made me try and find alternative ways of making the
                    cannonb instead of using a cylinder which lead me to find the screw modifier.
                </p>

                </div>

                After discussion with friends, family and tutors I discovered that certain things I could have added to
                the
                cannon to make it even better these were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding a better wheel shape </li>
                    <li>Adding more details such as fuse or more bolts</li>
                    <li>Add scene such as having cannon balls in the sceney</li>
                    <li>Needs better shading (Though I am new to the shading graph in blender I completely understand
                        why)</li>
                </ul>

                However, I did get good feedback about the topology and that it was effective method to how my client
                wanted the cannon. I attempted to add more to the cannon based on the feedback however, did not get time
                to finish it.

                <h1 class="section-title">What went well</h1>
                <hr class="section-divider" />
                I think the fact that I did all of it independently was a massive achievement and doing it using my own
                method.

                <h1 class="section-title">Even better if</h1>
                <hr class="section-divider" />
                I add more details to the model as it is very plane for the base of the cannon. Therefore, next time I will take my time
                and add details to the cannon.
