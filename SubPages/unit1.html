            I created a mood board because I need to brainstorm some ideas for what model I should make. These were my
            ideas which I thought of. I also decided to use a range of references and different styles to pick which one
            I thought would be best to do for the Unit.

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Why didn’t I choose the other models?</h2>
        <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Spaceship</strong> - I didn't chose to model a spaceship this is because it
                can prove difficult this is because you can make it as easy or
                hard as you like. From low poly to si-fi which can change the
                difficulty by a lot therefore, that would be too much to concider.
                With a limited deadline I thought that I should not do this.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Car</strong> - I didn't chose to model a car this is because I would of ended
                up over complicating things and picking the correct car model would be
                hard and also choosing a style (low poly, realistic or anime). This would
                overwealm me therefore, I didn't pick this.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Guns</strong> - I didn't model a gun this is because I think that a gun would
                be fun to model however, can be complicated depending on the style and
                gun itself. I also didn't want to do a gun because I thought that they
                look too plain if not enough detail is done and I could get side tracked.
                Due to wanting to add more detail to it. But, this could have been a
                good model to do this is because I could have used my <b>Airsoft rifle</b>
                as a first hand reference allowing me to add more detail to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ship</strong> - From low poly to high poly which can change the difficulty by a lot
                therefore, that would be too much to concider. However, if I break the model
                down I and focus on one part of trhe ship such as the cannon this could work.
                This is because I would be able to add detail and not get overwhelmed by modelling
                the entire ship.

        <p class="section-text">
            I decided to do 18th century naval cannons this because I believe that this model could help me with time
            management and would allow me to meet the deadline. I decided to make it Stylized realism themed because I
            think it would be fun to try and achieve this style.

        <p class="section-text">
            I created a second mood board this is because I wanted to get a deeper understanding of what I was

        <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Week 1:</strong> I managed to create a client profile which allowed me to start creating a mood
                board plan of ideas for which they might like. I then decided to make a form which contain research on
                who my audience is. After I found out they wanted a cannon I decided to create a second mood board which
                will allow me to have a deeper idea of what I am creating. This is good as it allows references and to
                understand what I am making better. As well as started to write my research and plan. This was an easy
                week and was able to do in 1 - 2 days. I also performed my primary research to find out more on who my
                audience is. I wanted to draft both my planning and research this is because I didn’t manage to achieve
                this goal, but I made a solid start.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Week 2:</strong> I started looking for a cannon blueprint which would allow me to see the
                different parts of the cannon in more detail. After researching a while I managed to find one which
                showed the parts and what I was aiming to model. I then inserted it into blender and managed and started
                modelling which you can find in the production section. As well as I finished my research and plan. But
                this is still an early version of it and will need to be rewritten. I wanted to start the model in this
                week but failed as the typing took longer than I thought it would.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Week 3:</strong> This is when I started my first attempt but it wasn't good and that I had to
                redo it this set me back however, the new method made it quick and easy to catch up therefore, I didn't
                fall behind as much as I thought I would have this means that I was on schedule for my deadline. I
                wanted to start the model in this week and did however, due to the first attempt failing I had less time
                on my second attempt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Week 4:</strong> This is when I started writing the reflection and rendering this is because the
                rendering did not take long and I knew already what I needed to work more on with the final week fast
                approaching I had to make a few shortcuts which then effected the quality of my model which I could have
                improved on. There was no goal set accept from making improvements to the typing stage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Week 5:</strong> This is the week when I decided to make sure that I covered all the work for
                the assessment this therefore, this was a mostly a typing week. So not much progress was made. However,
                I did quickly add some new features in the models however, hard to tell the difference. If I had more
                time, I could have fixed some of the materials and more details. My goal was making the model slightly
                better and improving the typing as this is an area which I strongly lack.

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Why I choose the cannon?</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            My client is a game designer who needs a cannon model for his upcoming 18th century naval game that will
            have a stylized realism aesthetic but would like 2 coloured renders and 2 clay renders as a wat to showcase
            their game. I am aiming to do a mid poly build which allows me to get a good amount of detail but not at the
            cost of more geometry than needed. For my requirements I would need to make sure that I stay with quads and
            avoid n-gons this is because in game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity they triangulate the mesh. It
            also helps in future proofing the model this is because people can do animations easier. This means a large
            variety of people will be using this model such as the game developer and their team this means I will have
            to bear that in mind as I will need to make sure the topology is good.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            The cannon will be placed upon a ship and can be animated with recoil and aiming allowing a better
            experience for the player. It will also be used for rendering this is because they want to include a
            sneak-peak towards their small indie company. This will be useful for the client as it is an important part
            of the game as it is a core mechanics. They will be using Unreal Engine 5 for this game and therefore, tris
            are not something to worry about unlike if it was Roblox Studio.

        <p class="section-text">
            For my secondary research I investigated the cannons history to understand the origin of the cannon and how
            it has evolved. The first use of a cannon was Europe and used between 1343-44. This was in a city called
            Algeciras.

        <p class="section-text">
            The age of sail was around 1571–1862, when large wooden ships ruled the seas. Which had a variety of
            cannons. However, the issues with cannons were that they were heavy and short range therefore, naval tactics
            was developed around this in mind. To also help get around this they started using brass cannons and was the
            most used.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Using a cannon was very hard this is because it required a great amount of labour to maintain, fire and
            reload. The cannon was broken up into 3 main pieces on the inside.

        <p class="section-text">
            I think that my techniques was time effective this is because it allowed me to proceed to make a cannon with
            good clean topology which allowed me to use quads whenever possible and to avoid n-gons. The reason for this
            is to help it when it gets imported into a game as it would be easy enough to triangulate.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            I’ve decided to use the techniques I used because I want to import into Unreal Engine meaning I had to bear
            in mind the formatting and understanding of Unreal Engine.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Through research I could not find if my method was industry standard however, due to the topology all being
            quads with no n-gons I think I did very well.

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Positives and negatives of rendering using cycles and Evee</h2>

        <p class="section-text">
            <strong>Evee:</strong>Is a real time rendering engine and is faster than cycles so people can use this to
            get a rough idea on what it could look like in cycles. This is because it is much lighter than Cycles. But
            it is not the best for photo realistic renders. This is because it is super inaccurate which often ruin some
            renders. Evee also does not support all shading nodes; therefore, it is also another limiting factor.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            <strong>Cycles:</strong>This provides the photo realistic renders which allows a lot better accuracy this is
            because it uses path-based ray tracing. It isn’t the best for performance and is very heavy.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Evee is the better on for cel-shading and stylised lighting and builds which is why I have choosen to do my renders
            for this. I also choose Evee because it would be quicker to render and better for performance as my PC isn't great
            at rendering. I could have choosen Cycles if I was going for a more realistic look. I also think that my lighting would
            be better in Evee than Cycles as Evee isn't realistic therefore, the light is treated in a different way.

                    These are the modifiers that I used once I applied the mirror modifier. I added a screw modifier
                    this is because it would create a clockwise shape follow the cannons shape. I added a subdivision
                    this is because it would help smoothen my mesh. This is done by dividing the mesh by 4 but as I
                    applied 2 it will be doing it 8 times giving it that smooth look that I need.

                    extrude and make a cylinder for the bottom. On the outer edge I used the extrude along normal which
                    gave it that little bump.

            I turned my interest quickly back to the main cannon this is because I noticed that the front of the cannon
            didn’t look well this is because there was a hole in the centre. To overcome this, I selected certain faces
            and deleted them then grid filled avoiding n-gons. I then extruded along normal to add the cannon chamber.
            However, an improvement I could have done is to of followed the plan instead of extruding at a random
            position.

            This is the final look at it in object mode. As my time runs shorter to the deadline. I realised that I
            would have to miss on a few details this is because I am not formula with the shader graph in blender and
            therefore, I assumed that it would take longer to do that than the details I wanted to add.

                I learned to make a cannon in a time effective way with good quality. Using unique methods as I did not
                see people using the same method as me. I browsed on YouTube and other sources and could not find people
                who have modelled like the way I did. However, I found a tutorial which could have helped me later if I
                were to of used it. But I wanted to try and be as independent as I could. This tutorial could have
                helped me with the cannon base.

            <p class="section-text">
                Below are the two videos that I mentioned. I believe that I would have benifited from Realistic version
                because they added more details on the base than I did.

                In this attempt I made it near enough as the method mentioned in my. However, I decided to make it using
                a cylinder for the main part of the cannon and to make the wheels more bulky. This caused the cannon to
                look sharp and more cubic. I also rushed this cannon which made me to take shortcuts and not care about
                the model as much as I should have done. On the other hand though it made me try and find alternative
                ways of making the cannon instead of using a cylinder which lead me to find the screw modifier.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                After discussion with friends, family and tutors I discovered that certain things I could have added to
                the cannon to make it even better these were:
            </p>

            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>
                    Adding a better wheel shape
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding more details such as fuse or more bolts
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add scene such as having cannon balls in the sceney
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wear and tear to add wood grain variation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Metal imperfections
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="section-text">
                However, I did get good feedback about the topology and that it was effective method to how my client
                wanted the cannon. I attempted to add more to the cannon based on the feedback however, did not get time
                to finish it.

            <h2 class="subsection-title">What went well</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                I think the fact that I did all of it independently was a massive achievement and doing it using my own
                method.
                I also enjoyed making the cannon as I used new methods which I have never done before.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Even better if</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                I could have used a anime theme as this was the orginal idea however, it looked more stylised. I add
                more details to the model as it is very plane for the base of the cannon. Therefore, next time I will
                take my time and add details to the cannon. I could have watched a tutorials and understand how they
                added detail and where mine lacked the most.
