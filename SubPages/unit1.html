                I created a mood board because I need to brainsstorm some ideas which
                my client might like. I decided to present different art styles to see
                which they would prefer. After a bit of thinking I decided
                to go with cannon this is because the cannon has a good scope and can
                assure that I meet the deadlines.

            <h2 class="subsection-title">Why I Didn’t Model the Others?</h2>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li>
                    Spaceship – I didn’t chose to model a spaceship this is because it
                    can vary in difficulty this is because you can make it as easy or
                    hard as you like. From low poly to si-fi which can change the 
                    difficulty by a lot therefore, that would be too much to concider.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Car – I didn’t chose to model a car this is because I would of ended
                    up over complicating things and picking the correct car model would be
                    hard and also choosing a style.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Guns – I didn’t model a gun this is because I think that a gun would
                    be easy to model however, can be complicated depending
                    on the style and gun itself. I also didn’t want to do a gun because
                    I thought that they look too plain if not enough detail is done and I
                    could get side tracked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ship – From low poly to si-fi which can change the difficulty by a lot 
                    therefore, that would be too much to concider. The methood used is also
                    another thing that would needing concering and I decided I like the theme
                    so I decided to go with the cannon.

            <p class="section-text">
                My client is a game designer who needs a cannon model for his upcoming
                18th century naval game that will have a anime aesthetic but would
                like 3 coloured renders and 2 clay renders. I am aiming to do a mid
                poly build which allows me to get a good amount of detail but not at
                the cost of more geometry than needed. For my requirements I would
                need to make sure that I stay with quads and avoid n-gons this is
                because in game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity they
                triangulate the mesh. It also helps in future proofing the model this
                is because people can do animations easier. This means a large variety
                of people will be using this model such as the game developer and
                their team this means I will have to bare that in mind as I will need
                to make sure the topology is good. The cannon will be placed upon a
                ship and can be animated with recoil and aiming allowing a better
                experience for the player. It will also be used for rendering this is
                because they want to include a sneak-peak towards their small indie
                company. This will be useful for the client as it is a important part
                of the game as it is a core mechanics. They will be using Unreal Engine 5
                for this game and therefore, tris are not something to worry about unlike if
                it was Roblox Studio.

                <strong>Week 1:</strong>I managed to create a client profile which
                allowed me to start creating a mood board plan of ideas for which they
                might like. After I found out they wanted a cannon I decided to create
                a second mood board which will allow me have a deeper idea of what I
                am creating. This is good as it allows references and to understand
                what I am making better. As well as started to write my research and
                plan.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Week 2:</strong>I started looking for a cannon blueprint which
                would allow me to see the different parts of the cannon in more
                detail. After researching a while I managed to find one which showed
                the parts and what I was aiming to model. I then inserted it into
                blender and managed and started modelling which you can find in the
                production section. As well as I finished my research and plan.

            <p class="section-text">
                <strong>Week 3:</strong> This is when I realised that my first attempt
                wasn’t good and that I had to redo it this set me back however, the
                new method made it quick and easy to catch up therefore, I didn’t fall
                behind as much as I thought I would have this means that I was on
                schedule for my deadline.

                <strong>Week 4:</strong>This is when I started writing the reflection
                and rendering this is because the rendering did not take long and I
                knew already what I needed to work more on with the final week fast
                approaching I had to make a few shortcuts which then effected the

                I am modelling a cannon this is because they are small and fairly easy
                to model this allows me to scope my project this is because I am
                limited for time and need to focus with something which I can assure
                myself that I will meet the deadline. I have also chosen a cannon
                because I think it can help with my final major project of making a 3D
                ship which is based in the 18th century.

            <p class="section-text">
                The first recorded use of a cannon in Europe was to defend the city of
                Algeciras during the siege of 1343-44. This was the start of the
                cannon era as it continued to evolve cannons where separated by 3
                classes

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Light Cannons:</strong> These were small and mobile
                    cannons that could be easily moved on the battlefield. They were
                    typically used for anti-personnel purposes and had a relatively
                    short range. These was often used for defensive messures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Medium Cannons:</strong> These were larger than light
                    cannons and had a longer range. They were often used in field
                    battles and ships, capable of firing heavier projectiles and
                    inflicting more damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Heavy Cannons:</strong> These were the largest and most
                    powerful cannons, often used in sieges to breach fortifications.
                    They required a crew to operate and were less mobile due to
                    their size and weight.
                </li>
            </ul>

            This often depended on the size of the cannon ball as well as there are different weight.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>18</strong>:</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>24</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>32</strong>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>64</strong>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>68</strong>
                </li>

            </ul>

            This is the weight that the cannon balls weighted and would often effect the range and accuracy of it.

            <div class="image-gallery-vertical">
                <img src="../Images/Unit1/About.png" alt="">

            </div>

            The cannon was separated into 7 categories which are labelled in the image above.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Muzzle:</strong>The muzzle is a point of vulnerability as if there was too much pressure the
                    cannon could peel like a banana as this is where the cannon ball is released from. </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chase:</strong> This is the thinnest part of the cannon and was also to help to improve
                    accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>First/Second reinforce</strong> This helped reinforce the cannon so that it reduces the
                    chance of peeling.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Vent</strong> This was so that there was a way to provides an external opening to ignite the
                    propellant charge of gunpowder inside the barre
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Base ring:</strong> This was a primary attachment point for a breeching loop
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Cascable:</strong> This part was also for a attachment.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>68</strong>
                </li>



            </ul>

            18th century cannons could also be made out of both iron and bronze they both had advantages and
            disadvantages depending on what it was used for. Iron ones are more common this is because it was lighter
            and less expensive however, it was more vulnerable to the elements and rusted easily.

                        360 degrees allowing a full spiral shape for my cannon. The Axis is the way that the
                        spiral shape would be along and axis object allowed me to use the marker positioning it

                        without bevelled the edges. This was more of a aesthetic choice for what I wanted to do.

                        delete the face and extrude and scale inwards a little then grid fill. With the outer edge I
                        extruded it to add some more depth. I also cut in half and mirrored it with a subdivision.

                        all the faces and replaced for grid fill therefore, avoiding n-gons. I mirrored it the body and
                        copy and pasted it across to the other placement of the wheels.

                        Blender and wanted a starting point. However, I did change some of the settings adjusting for
                        the final version of image 24.This one was inspired by the cannon nodes but a little part from
                        Mr_Forke The Basics of Anime in Blender #3.2 - Advanced Anime Wood Textures combined with the
                        cannon material which gave me the wood effect for both wood material 1 and 2. I decided to have
                        2 wood materials as wheel would often be a darker variant of the wood.

                I learned to make a cannon in a time effective way with good quality. Using unique methods as I did not
                see people using the same method as me. This was good as I had to learn through my own mistakes which
                allowed me to get a greater understanding of Blender. However, there are areas of improvement such as
                shading since I do not think it catches the anime aesthetic which I was aiming for but, for my first
                introduction to shading in blender I think it was good. I could have done deeper research into the a
                pacific type of anime style instead of anime in general. This could have helped me understand more of
                what I was doing within the shading.

                I also learned not to settle for your first attempt this is because I didn’t do a lot of detail and that
                the original mesh wasn’t too great and lacked a lot of detail which was shown later in my newer mesh.
                But in both files I could have improved the naming of each separate mesh instead of letting Blender
                generate names for me.

                I had my first go at trying to use the shading graph in blender and understanding the usage of it.
                However, this is one of my weaker areas and need to gain more knowledge on it
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                In this attempt I made it near enough as the method mentioned in my
                [Production](https://www.notion.so/Production-28336ffc9d2680028a66cdaf76539b45?pvs=21). However, I
                decided to make it using a cylinder for the main part of the cannon and to make the wheels more bulky.
                This caused the cannon to look sharp and more cubic then a real cannon.

                I also rushed this cannon which made me to take shortcuts and not care about the model as much as I
                should have done. On the other hand though it made me try and find alternative ways of making the cannon
                instead of using a cylinder which lead me to find the screw modifier.
            </p>

                <img src="../Images/Unit1/ClayRenderFailed.png" alt="">
            </div>

            After discussion with friends, family and tutors I discovered that certain things I could have added to the
            cannon to make it even better these were:
            <ul>
                <li>Adding a better wheel shape </li>
                <li>Adding more details such as fuse or more bolts</li>
                <li>Add scene such as having cannon balls in the sceney</li>
                <li>Needs better shading (Though I am new to the shading graph in blender I completely understand why)</li>
            </ul>

            However, I did get good feedback about the topology and that it was effective method to how my client wanted the cannon
