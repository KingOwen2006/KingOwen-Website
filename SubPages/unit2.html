        <p class="section-text">
            My game will is an open-world racing based in Tokyo, Japan. This will be a free-form exploration which you can participate in AI or multiplayer powered racing. The world will have a anime shaded theme which embraces anime culture. Explore the streets of Tokyo and climb through ranks or drive freely with no limits.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Game Objective</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2 class"subsection-title">Main Objective</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I am aiming to make this game so that people can unwind and take in the buildings which Tokyo has for those who want to visit. The purpose of this game is to provide players with an engaging open world racing game, allowing the player to relax or, if they want to, be competitive against smart AI cars or play with friends. The main objective is to race against AI or your friends and become the top of the leader board in every race. Or, alternatively, sit back and take in the views of the game.
        </p>

        <h2 class"subsection-title">Gameplay Goals</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I want the player to experience the roads in Tokyo with a new look of anime to embrace the Japanese culture.  I want the player to feel free with no limits and explore the map. But if they are feeling competitive then why not race with the AI or with others. These races are suppose to feel hard and challenging for the player to aim high on the leader boards but for those that don’t feel that competitive they can go with something more casual and relaxed and drive around the map. I want the player to react in different ways based on their mood when playing. For example, people who want to drive around the map might feel like following the speed limits or racing as fast as they can.
        </p>

        <h2 class"subsection-title">Presentation Goals</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I want the players to feel immersive within the world as they are part of it. Taking in the scenery and beating their personal best. I want all assets to look like they belong in an anime and that the player is part of that anime show. In order to give this immersive goal I will need to consider audio, graphics, interface and more. 
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Game Engine</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />
        <p class="section-text">
            I will be using the Unreal Engine (5.6), which is full optimized and has many features which can be built upon it. This is because Unreal Engine has a plugin called Cesium which allows me to import google maps. I have also chosen Unreal Engine as I am more familiar with it.  Unreal also comes with a free driving template, which I can use and refine in order to get a large majority of the game play done. However, I did consider unity and Godot, but they lacked the features which I wanted; such as visual scripting, which I am more familiar with.

        <ul class="section-list">
            <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Primary research often is first hand research which has not been done before. The benefits of primary is that it will be up to date and is more accurate towards my target audience.  </li>
            <li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Secondary research is second hand research often being done by someone else and sources from Wikipedia or books which can be out of date. </li>
