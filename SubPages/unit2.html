        <p class="section-text">
            I am aiming to make this game so that people can unwind and take in the buildings which Tokyo has for those who want to visit. The purpose of this game is to provide players with an engaging open world racing game, allowing the player to relax or, if they want to, be competitive against smart AI cars or play with friends. The main objective is to race against AI or your friends and become the top of the leader board in every race. Or, alternatively, sit back and take in the views of the game.
