        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <p class="section-text">
            My game will is an open-world racing based in Tokyo, Japan. This will be a free-form exploration which you
            can participate in AI or multiplayer powered racing. The world will have a anime shaded theme which embraces
            anime culture. Explore the streets of Tokyo and climb through ranks or drive freely with no limits.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Game Objective</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Main Objective</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I am aiming to make this game so that people can unwind and take in the buildings which Tokyo has for those
            who want to visit. The purpose of this game is to provide players with an engaging open world racing game,
            allowing the player to relax or, if they want to, be competitive against smart AI cars or play with friends.
            The main objective is to race against AI or your friends and become the top of the leader board in every
            race. Or, alternatively, sit back and take in the views of the game.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Gameplay Goals</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I want the player to experience the roads in Tokyo with a new look of anime to embrace the Japanese culture.
            I want the player to feel free with no limits and explore the map. But if they are feeling competitive then
            why not race with the AI or with others. These races are suppose to feel hard and challenging for the player
            to aim high on the leader boards but for those that don’t feel that competitive they can go with something
            more casual and relaxed and drive around the map. I want the player to react in different ways based on
            their mood when playing. For example, people who want to drive around the map might feel like following the
            speed limits or racing as fast as they can.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Presentation Goals</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I want the players to feel immersive within the world as they are part of it. Taking in the scenery and
            beating their personal best. I want all assets to look like they belong in an anime and that the player is
            part of that anime show. In order to give this immersive goal I will need to consider audio, graphics,
            interface and more.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Game Engine</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />
        <p class="section-text">
            I will be using the Unreal Engine (5.6), which is full optimized and has many features which can be built
            upon it. This is because Unreal Engine has a plugin called Cesium which allows me to import google maps. I
            have also chosen Unreal Engine as I am more familiar with it. Unreal also comes with a free driving
            template, which I can use and refine in order to get a large majority of the game play done. However, I did
            consider unity and Godot, but they lacked the features which I wanted; such as visual scripting, which I am
            more familiar with.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Target Audience</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />
        <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Primary:</strong> Primary research often is first hand research which has not been done before.
                The benefits of primary is that it will be up to date and is more accurate towards my target audience.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Secondary:</strong> Secondary research is second hand research often being done by someone else
                and sources from Wikipedia or books which can be out of date.

            Research is important because it allows you to understand your target audience and who your game is targeted
            at. This will allows you to build own audience and target the game towards them.

            I created a form which allowed me to create a profile for my audience. I asked a range of questions some
            being generic response and more focused questions. As the form progressed I asked different type of
            questions which are more focused to what I wanted the game to be about.

            I managed to get a lot of answers which allowed me to get a good amount of data to help provide for my game.
            This data showed me my age of audince is under 18 and the majority being male however, I do have female
            response. 91.67% chose PC as their main gaming platform. Most people are willing to spend £60. I do think
            the survey could have been expanded on with more direct questions as it developed. But overall I managed to
            get fair response due to the multiple choice and advoiding biass opinions.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            I did secondary research this was researching my competition which are
        </p>

        <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Forza franchises:</strong> there are numerous versions from meaning it is one of the biggest
                competitors this is good as it can show that the niche is well established and can be built upon. Forza
                is a open world racing game with many storyline across their games.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Ananta (Unreleased):</strong> this game is unreleased and not primarily focused on racing
                however, it does feature unique car mechanics with a anime theme which is a huge inspiration to the
                project. As it is unreleased I have not be able to play it however, the reviews on the driving element
                is amazing therefore, it should be classed as a competitor as it has 2 elements which is inspired by it.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Assetto Corsa:</strong> this is very well known for realistic physics and it’s modding community
                this allows a lot of flexibility because they can add cars which aren’t suppose to be in game and can
                use them. It also allows them to add their own maps which allows the community to get very involved in
                the game.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 class="section-title">Platform</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />
        <p class="section-text">
            I’m going to be aiming at PC this is because a large majority of gamers play on PC and not console based on
            my audience. However I am open to console and mobile releases if the game performs well I hope to allow
            support for those consoles.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Technical specs</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />
        <p class="section-text">
            I do not yet know what my Technical specs however, based on my requirements for the engine I can get a rough
            idea on what it will be. Once game is completed I could also use performance profilers and hardware testing
            on different machines to identify bottlenecks and set realistic minimum and recommended specs
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Gameplay</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Mechanics</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I plan on adding driving controller which can be a combination of realistic such as beam mg or Assetto Corsa
            which are well known games within the industry. I also plan on adding a racing system with advanced AI to
            simulate real time racing. I am also planning to add multiplayer. I also want the players to be able to
            customise their own cars
        </p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Story</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            The story is you are a low ranking rookie who seeks to take first place as you race along the streets in
            Tokyo. Win the cups and become the ultimate racing champion. Do you think you have what it takes?
        </p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">UI</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            The UI of the game is going to be basic as I don’t want the player to feel overwhelmed when playing the game
            and having to look all over the screen for certain points of interest therefore, I will have a speedometer
            and a mini map during the actual game however, in pause menu there will be a lot more options such as
            customisation for the car and different ways of customisation the game itself such as what you want to
            appear in game.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Presentation </h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Visual</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            For my visuals I want to add post processing which can be used in numerous ways to give it a anime style. I
            can use this post processing for creating lighting effects such as depth of field and saturation. I can also
            use post processing to give the world a anime style which can be used by using a post processing material
            the same effect can be used for different lighting during day and night.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            I am going for a Initial D anime style this is because it’s a anime which is heavily based on cars which
            would give a more familiar style to those who have seen the anime and a style which could be replicated into
            a game.
        </p>

        <div class="image-gallery-vertical">
            <img src="../Images/Unit2/Initial D anime.webp" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="section-text">
            As you will be in the car there will be no need to add characters however, voice lines for story should be
            included to add more attention into the game as it gives the player a objective to do.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Initial D: is a gaming franchises which appeared in 1998 and is still ongoing with their latest game being
            released in 2023. However, they lack their anime theme which was made in 1998 but the manga appeared 1995 -
            2013.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subsection-title">Audio</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            I plan on using live sounds meaning for each car in the game will have its own real engine from the real car
            this will help build a sense of atmosphere. I also want to add live radio station so people can listen in
            real time. The reason for realistic audio is to add more depth within the game and to make it more unique.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Possible Hurdles </h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <p class="section-text">
            There a numerous hurdles in the way which I’ll have to overcome in order for this game to be developed.
        </p>

        <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Quality not quantity:</strong> I want my game to be to a good quality not quantity this is
                because it is very hard to model good looking cars and buildings. It will also be by picking a starting
                point after the block out weather to do the map first or to model a few cars.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>AI:</strong> This could be as easy or hard as I want it to be this is because there are many
                different ways of going about AI weather to hard code it into blueprints or use a behaviour tree which
                can use more advanced algorithms in order to make them more realistic. Due to I want quality not
                quantity this means I’ll have to go down the behaviour trees and to use splines to help outline the
                track for the AI to follow.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Multiplayer:</strong> This will require c++ and networking which I have done before therefore I
                lack experience and could be a major road block in the game and could halt development until I am more
                experienced.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Authorization of use of brand and engine:</strong> This is important as the cars will be
                inspired by their 1:1 replicas which could cause legal problems for the game development as companies
                could say no and forbids me to using their cars and engine noises. This is also a issue for use of radio
                stations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="section-text">
            I will over come these hurdles by separating each one into their own unreal engine project this will allow
            me to work on systems more effectively as I would not feel overwhelmed when working on it. Then I will
            combine them and tidy them up when needed.
