        <p class="section-text">
            This game is a open world RPG  game which is currently in development by the Hangzhou-based studio Naked
            Rain and published by NetEase. The style is anime cel-shaded which can add for fun combat as it can break
            physical limits which we don’t have in real life. The audience for the game Ananta is very large this is
            because it plans to be released on all platforms and aiming for people who enjoy  open-world RPGs and those
            that play games such as GTA, Batman Arkham. The story of the game is that you play the role of an elite
            agent for the Anti-Chaos Directorate (A.C.D.) in the open-world city of Nova City.

                    This is a close shot this is because it zooms into the the character allowing a better connection
                    between the player and character. This is done as you can see more emotion within the facial
                    expressions. Here you can see the main character thinking.

                <p class="section-text">
                    This is a very wide shot this is because it can see the environment with the point of interest being
                    the red car as it stands out. This allows the player to get a sense of location as they drive
                    through the city. Here you can see that they are on a dual carriage way. The lighting also
                    represents happiness due to it’s bright colours.

                    This is a wide shot this is because we can see both environment and characters allowing us to see
                    more of the scene. This allows the player to see what is happening. Here they are driving on a
                    bridge and taking in the scenery.

                    This is a over the shoulder shot this is because it can be used to build tension. Here you can see
                    the main character overlooking some bad guys building tension between them as it looks like we are
                    being sneaky.

                <p class="section-text">
                    This is a wide shot this is because it features numerous characters and the environment allowing the
                    player to get a better sense on what is happening. In this scene we can see that we are a camera
                    which allows the player to gather information on what is happening in the other room

                <p class="section-text">
                    This is a ariel shot this is because it features a large majority of the city from top view. This
                    allows it to showcase it’s large open world rpg. In this we can feel the significance of how big the
                    city is making the player want to explore more.

        <p class="section-text">
            The timing of the trailer is fast and action packed this builds tension within the trailer. It also
            showcases a large amount of gameplay showing the best of it. In the intro we are introduced to the two main
            characters wondering how they got there and that they forgot their paycheck. We then get a montage between
            different points of interest in the game. As it shifts more into destruction and combat. Which features in
            the gameplay. With a fade that has reparation of phrases.

        <p class="section-text">
            This game is a 3D platformer game which is currently in development by a indie dev (Raymond Cripps). The
            style is anime cel-shaded which can add for fun combat as it can break physical limits which we don’t have
            in real life and designed to be a fasted pace allowing interesting speed runs. The audience for the game is
            for those who follow his socials and those that like 3D platformers. The story is currently changing this is
            because it is still in early development and not finalised as there is no confirmed released date. However,
            there is a open pre-alpha where you can play the current version.

                <p class="section-text">
                    This is a wide shot this is because of the FOV is more stretched therefore, allowing the player to
                    see more of the world. The effect of this allows the player to make it feel like they are running
                    super fast.

                <p class="section-text">
                    This is a very wide shot this is because the the FOV is further away from the character and you can
                    see the word. This is to show how fast they are going around.

                <p class="section-text">
                    This is a close shot which also had a bit of camera shake. This is because it shows the amount of
                    power that the character has.

            The timing of the trailer is fast and action packed and very quick this is also heavily gameplay instead of
            cinematic shots like the last one. It is also edited in a way like montage. This means it feels less of a
            trailer and more of a gameplay demo. Due to it not inclueding any cinemtaic shots it is less engaging.
            However,
            this is a indie game and it is not a trailer for a release. All the shots are the same therefore, it is less
            diversed but makes it up in the transitions. It is also shorter than the last trailer.

        <h1 class="section-title">Compare the trailers</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <p class="section-text">
            In a side by side comparation I would say that the Ananta trailer was more interesting and hooking as it
            showed numerous different types of gameplay which hooked me in more. However, comparing a indie game and
            industry game is unfair.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            These two games are very different the Ananta trailer is for a release and the
            Project Feline trailer is for a pre-alpha. They have the same theme with both being anime games. They are
            made very different from each other and you can see the difference instantly. I love the duration of
            Project Feline trailer it is short and to the pont whereas, Ananta trailer is long and engaging shwoing
            different
            gameplay features and cutscenes. This encourges me to want to buy the game.
        </p>


        <h1 class="section-title">What features do I want in mine</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />

        <p class="section-text">
            I want to use numerous camera angles and transitions as it will hook the target audience to it. Ananta
            trailer had a large amount of cutscenes at the start and shifts to the gameplay. I want to do the same
            thing. But with the quick and fast edits that Project Feline trailer had.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Which game am I doing?</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />
        <p class="section-text">
            The game i have chosen is Dragon Ball Z Kakarot this is because I believe a mix of both cinematic and
            gameplay for this game will make a good trailer. I also think it will be good because it's captures some of
            the story telling that the anime had. I would also be able to get the style I want from this game. As it has
            the requirements that I have fot the trailer. This is because of the amount of cutscenes and gameplay.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            The audience is aimed at those who are already interested in the dragon ball franchise however it's age
            demographic is aimed for 12 up. It's aimed at those who is into anime games this is because a large majority
            of them have very similar gameplay mechanics.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">Who is the target audience?</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider" />
        <p class="section-text">
            The trailer is aimed at those who have an interest in the dragon ball z kakarot or anime games this is
            because most anime games follow the same formula. I'm also planning to release the trailer on YouTube this
            means on average 12+ age ranges this means the demographic has a large age rating.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Dragon ball Z kakarot has already achieved a audience with the recognition from the loved anime dragon ball
            and also for the developers CyberConnect2.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            The best reach for my audience is social media such as YouTube this is because they used the same platform
            and managed to get good like to dislike ratio and viewers was much entertained allowing the view time to go
            up.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">What is the purpose of the trailer</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider">
        <p class="section-text">
            I am making this trailer so that I can showcase Dragon ball Z kakarot at it peak with battles from the anime
            as well as the different characters you can play as showcasing all the unique ideas and gameplay. To show
            the Dragon Ball fans the unlimited potential the game has. This is for the audience of Dragon Ball Z kakarot
            with its age demographic and those that are interested in anime.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            The USP is that it will bring the anime and game together recreating iconic scenes from the anime allowing
            people to make their own side by side comparison.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-title">What is the plan for my trailer</h1>
        <hr class="section-divider">
        <p class="section-text">
            I want to introduce the 3 main villains from dragon ball Z (frieza cell and buu) this introduction will show
            their opening cut scenes. This will go on for around 25 - 30 seconds
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            We are then introduced to the main characters such as Goku (kakarot is his Saiyan name) and the side
            characters (krillin gohan and vegeata) (45 - 50 seconds)
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            We will then see a montage between all 3 fights against the villain. (35 - 45 seconds) in this short time
            you will see the beginning middle and end of those fights
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            Finally you will be able to see the introduction which then title screen which will end the trailer.
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            The song that I have gone for is Numb Pain this is because I think that the song would greatly reflect the
            tension
            between the fights and that
        </p>

                <strong>Week 1:</strong> I started my planning and exploring what type of games I should record these
                game where some of the following Fortnite rocket league and roblox however I chose against these ideas
                because
                <ul class="section-list">
                    <li>
                        Fortnite: it feels super over rated knower days and would have felt less effort due to how many
                        opportunities that it can provide.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Rocket league: this was one of my ideas however due to its limited gameplay and though replays
                        looked good i could not use the .replay files in my editor of choice.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Roblox: it's not a game as such and more of a platform which contains games which would have
                        created more options to choose from and get distracted by.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Week 2:</strong> I finished my plan and now I need to start my research this is where I had to
                chose 2 already made trailers and annotate them. This was difficult but I picked the two games which I
                am mostly looking forward to playing.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Week 3:</strong> This is when I started to record my footage on OBS for the game i decided on in
                my plan. However this was not done in one session and did run to week 4.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Week 4:</strong> This was a recording week using OBS as the footage recorded was scattered
                throughout the game and i would have to replay the game in order to get the required clips.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Week 5: </strong> This is the week of editing research and editing itself. I first wanted to
                pick my video editor as we had a choice on what software to use. I use windows during college but at
                home I use Linux therefore I neded to find one that is compatible with both operating systems which
                ended up being….. I then looked at some tutorials and followed them using my own footage as tests. At
                the end of the week I started to video edit but ran into week 6
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Week 6: </strong> At the start of this week I started to understand the software and by end of
